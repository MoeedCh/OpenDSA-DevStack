# Placeholder file for code-workout project within DevStack

This file should never be pushed to the [code-workout repo](https://github.com/web-cat/code-workout)!

The [OpenDSA-DevStack repo](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA-DevStack) uses this file as a placeholder for where the code-workout project would get set up, if the developer wants it set up. (`docker-compose` throws errors if this folder is missing)
